At the end of this journey, I would like to thank all the people who guided me and shared these five years with me.\\
First and foremost, I want to express my gratitude to Professor Roberto Balbinot who, after having taught me the most fascinating aspects of general relativity and quantum mechanics and how they intertwine, helped me with his advices in deciding which direction to take to conclude my master's degree.\\
I am deeply grateful to Dr. Fabio Finelli for his invaluable guidance over these months: thank you for wlcoming me to INAF-OAS and for teaching me how to move the first steps in the world of scientific research, sharing your knowledge on the cutting-edge problems of contemporary cosmology. \\
Many thanks also go to Dr. Matteo Tagliazucchi, who helped me with his expertise in spectral distortions. I am also indebted to Dr. Angelo Ferrari for his invaluable help in setting up the DIFA cluster to run my codes.

Words cannot express my gratitude to my parents, who have always encouraged me to pursue my curiosity and search for answers to the many questions that I raise. From the VHS tape on the Big Bang I used to watch  as a child to the books on atoms or spacetime that you gifted me, all those things habe become a part of me, probably what I will devote my life to from now on. Thank you for giving me the opportunity to become a physicist. I cannot forget here my granddad Gigi: probably you will not be able to read this but the memories of all the afternoons you spent teaching me of electric circuits, disassembling capacitors, repairing random things or simply letting me be your "Vice amministratore" are a fundamental part of the person I am today.\\
I want to thank from the bottom of my heart Giulia: we met for the first time between the desks of Aula A, and in these two years (probably tomorrow or the day after) we have shared our passion for physics and many other things. Thank you for your constant support, your understanding, and especially for all the times you listened and helped find solutions to all the problems I faced. I am really grateful that now you are such a fundamental part of my life.\\
I also want to thank my friends from Casale: Samuele, Matteo and Zillo. Although our lives are taking different routes, you all always have been a safe place to return to, caring friends I can always rely on.\\
Special thanks to Cristina, with whom I shared my house for these five years. Thanks for all the laboratories we shared and the anime we watched while having dinner. Also thanks for having kept our house clean and tidy while having tried all my culinary experiments. 

To conclude I want to thank all the friends I met along this journey. Starting with Marco Piolanti for you sincere friendship that goes beyond living in two different cities. I know that independently of the obstacles we may face in our lives there will be always a sushi to organize together. Really thanks to Damiano for the endless discussions on quantum gravity and theology, for all the Friday nights at the oratorio. You two guys are my most important friends here in Bologna, and I truly hope with all my heart that our friendships will last forever. I also want to thank all the friends of \emph{zitaket}: Andrea, Federico, Marco Benazzi, Marco Mullazzani, Matteo Bonazzi, Matteo Zandi and Michel, thank you all for having shared this journey with me. Last but not least, I have to thank all the friends I met at the \emph{Treno dei Chlochard}, especially Gigi, Gianmarco, Marco, Lia, Letizia, Anna e Loredana.
