At the end of this journey I would like to thank all the people that guided me and that shared with me these years.\\
First and foremost, I  to Professor Roberto Balbinot that, after having taught me of most beautiful aspects of general relativity and quantum mechanics, helped me with his advices deciding on which direction to take to conclude my master degree.\\
I am deeply grateful to Dr. Fabio Finelli for his inestimable guidance in these months: thank you for having welcomed me at INAF-OAS and for having taught how to move my first steps in the world scientific research.\\
Many thanks should go also to Dr. Matteo Tagliazucchi, who helped me with his expertise on spectral distortions.\\
I am also indebted to Dr. Angelo Ferrari for his invaluable help in setting the DIFA cluster to run my codes.

Words cannot express my gratitude to my parents that have always encouraged me to pursue in the quest of finding the answer to the many question that i raise: from the VHS of the Big Bang i used to watch when I was a child to the books on atoms or spacetime that you gifted me, now those thing are truly a part of me, probably what I will from now on in my life. Thank you for you for having given me the possibility of being a physicist.\\
I cannot forget here my granddad Gigi: probably you will not be able to read this but the memories of all the afternoons you spent teaching me of electric circuits, disassembling capacitors, repairing random things or just letting me be your "Vice amministratore" are all part of the person I am today.\\
A really special thanks to Giulia: we met between the desks of Aula A and in these two years (probably tomorrow or the day after) we shared our passion for physics and many other things. Thank you for your continuous support, for your understanding, and especially for all the times you listened to me. Thank you also for all the memories that we share here in Bologna: all the "Piadine di Sole e Luna", all the sushi together, ... 
I also want to thank my friends from Casale: Samuele, Matteo and Zillo. Thank you for \\
Special thanks to Cristina, with who I shared my house in this five years. Thanks for all the discussions we had and the animes we watched while having dinner. Also thanks for having kept our house clean and tidy. 

To conclude I want to thank from the bottom of my heart all the friends I met during this journey. Starting with Marco Piolanti for you sincere friendship that goes beyond living in two different cities. Really thank to Damiano for the infinite discussions on quantum gravity and theology, for all the fridays night at the oratorio. I also want to thanks all the friends of \emph{zitaket}: Andrea, Federico, Marco Benazzi, Matteo Bonazzi, Matteo Zandi and Michel, thank you all for having shared this journey with me. Last but not least, I have to tank all the friends i met at the \emph{Treno dei Chlochard}: Gigi, Gianmarco, Marco, Lia, Letizia, Anna, Loredana and all the friends that I met.
