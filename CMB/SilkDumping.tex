\section{Silk dumping}
Primordial perturbations, when reentering the Hubble horizon after inflation, they can generate small fluctuation in the temperature of the plasma. In this way, photons from the hotter and denser regions will diffuse in the blackbody radiation of the plasma and produce distortions in the \emph{CMB spectrum}. This effect is called \emph{Silk damping} and it mainly consists of two processes: \textbf{mixing of blackbodies} and \textbf{comptonization}.\\ We will now show that the first one produces \emph{y-distortions} while the latter will turn these distortions in \emph{$\mu$-distortions}.
\subsection{Mixing of blackbodies}\label{sec:MixingOfBlackbodies}
To start we recall the main formulae that describe a blackbody radiation: given the phase space distribution of a black body
$$f(\nu,T)=\bigg(\exp\bigg\{\frac{\nu}{k_BT}\bigg\}-1\bigg)^{-1}=\bigg(e^x-1\bigg)^{-1},\qquad \text{with }x=\frac{\nu}{k_BT},$$
we can evaluate the energy, the entropy and the number of photons in the radiation $$E=a_{R}T^4,\qquad S=\frac{4}{3}a_RT^3,\qquad N=b_{R}T^3.$$
