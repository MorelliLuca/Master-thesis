\chapter{Spectral Distortions}
\label{chap:SpectralDistortions}
As the \emph{CMB} is composed of photons, it is reasonable to that it should be described as some black body radiation. Indeed, the measurements from COBE/FIRAS satellite \cite{COBE1996} showed that the CMB spectrum is very compatible with a black body radiation.\\
However, many physical processes could affect the spectrum of the CMB generating some \textbf{spectral distortions} that were not detectable by the previous experiments.

In the next sections we will discuss the theory of spectral distortions and the physical processes that could generate them. Our goal is to describe a particular process called \textbf{Silk dumping} that allows for dissipation of the primordial perturbation to generate the distortions
